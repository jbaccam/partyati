# Shop presentation controls

The shop follows the supplied reference: four tall offers on desktop, two columns on medium screens and one on narrow phones. Price buttons sit inside the cards; locks sit below. Sold offers disappear. Owned item and weapon icons pack into the lower inventory without empty placeholder boxes. Weapon selection dims the shop and anchors a tier-colored detail panel above its icon. Short screens scroll detail contents.

The source of truth is `ShopUI.luau`; `WeaponInventoryUI.luau` contains the shared uploaded artwork mapping, used by both shop and creative inventory. `assets/weapons/provenance.json` records original filenames and Roblox IDs. The supplied set now has all 36 weapon images, including Glock.

Supported layout controls on ReplicatedStorage.ShopUI:

| Attribute | Value | Effect |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| HorizontalMargin | 0.025 | Fractional left/right margin |
| CardHeight | 390 | Maximum offer height; short views fit to available space with a 310-pixel minimum and scrolling |
| StatsWidth | 310 | Maximum stats column width |

Inventory size follows content; columns and detail positions adapt automatically. Older fixed-slot layout attributes are retained for compatibility but no longer control the content-sized inventory. Use Stop/Play after editing source. Edits during Play are temporary; keep permanent Studio changes synchronized with this repository.

See `SHOP_UI_VALIDATION.md` for this revision's validation and remaining limits.
